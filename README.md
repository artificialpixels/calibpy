# Calipy

Calipy is a camera calibration and registration toolbox. It is based on [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and implements an easy access to internal and  external camera calibration using [ChArUco Boards](https://calib.io/pages/camera-calibration-pattern-generator). The external calibration routines are tested and guaranteed to be consistent with the Blender coordinate conventions.
